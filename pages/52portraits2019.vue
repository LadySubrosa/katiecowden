      <p>
        I'm taking 52 portraits in 2019, to get back into doing photography for
        fun, and to document the people in my life. It's a challenge to myself
        to work in a variety of styles, with people of different ages, races,
        and genders. At the end of the year, I hope to have improved my portrait
        skills, and have acquired new work for my portfolio.
